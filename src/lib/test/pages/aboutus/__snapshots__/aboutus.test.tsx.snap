    An About Us page is a spot for your founding story, a place to show off your business wins, and a sales page that answers the most pressing question new customers have about your business.
    <br />
    What an About Us page should be is a goal-oriented sales page, one that focuses on highlighting the biggest selling points of your story and brand at the top of the page, making a strong first impression on curious customers.
