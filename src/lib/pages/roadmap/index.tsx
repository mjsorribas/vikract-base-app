        An About Us page is a spot for your founding story, a place to show off
        your business wins, and a sales page that answers the most pressing
        question new customers have about your business.
        <br />
        What an About Us page should be is a goal-oriented sales page, one that
        focuses on highlighting the biggest selling points of your story and
        brand at the top of the page, making a strong first impression on
        curious customers.
